Make it a full config builder:
 - add a node 
 - IP address 
 - macaroon

Two "modes"
- Create config; will add nodes and create full config.json
- Create activity: takes config.json (if you already have it) and fills in (overwirting) activity.

Interval between payments (seconds)? Note that 1 is the default (change to 10)
Remove action type (for now)

High / low: 
- High: 5 second frequency, amt 100k
- Low: 5 second frequency, 100 sats

Pick your frequency?
- H/M/L (show values)
- High (1 second)
- Low (1 hour)

Pick you amount?
- H/M/L (as above) OR % of sender channel balance

~~~
Source is from nodes
Destination is from graph

Random source and destiantion - does have validation.
